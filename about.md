I just completed my PhD in Software Engineering at TU Delft. Now I am seeking new role. My main research topic includes Software Testing, Debugging, Software Quality, Fault Predication, Mutation Testing, Static Analysis and everything related to Software. Besides research, I am also interested in applying what I have learned in the real world. I am always keeping a close eye in Economics, Biology, Chemistry and E-commerce.  You can find me by <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">Email</a>.
