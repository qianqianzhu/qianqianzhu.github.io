As a PhD in software engineering, I have a solid foundation in software engineering and always foster best practices in software development and use. My PhD study is centred at software testing, where I acquired a detailed understanding of software engineering, including coding standards, version control, testing, review, continuous integration and quality control. My expertise in software testing and quality assurance can assist in the implementation of new algorithms, refactoring existing codebase, adding up-to-date tests and documents. Also, I can contribute to software maintenance, including issue identification, defects repair and regular software releases.
