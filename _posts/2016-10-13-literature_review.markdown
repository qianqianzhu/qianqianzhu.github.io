### Important take-aways from the Literature Survey

We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) on mutation testing, with a particular focus on the understanding of how people actually apply mutation testing and how they cope with the well-known limitations of mutation testing, e.g., the cost to generate mutants. Our systematic literature review is based on a collection of 191 papers from 22 venues. In this post, we will mainly present the lessons we learned from the literature survey. In particular, we are going to highlight three primary findings from our systematic literature review.
